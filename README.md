# Day 7 – Real-Time Searchable UI with Debounce and Tailwind Layout

This project is part of my 150-day developer preparation journey, focused on building performant and scalable interfaces in React. On Day 7, I developed a modular search experience with dynamic filtering, custom hooks, and responsive design.

## ✅ What I Practiced:
- Controlled input handling in React
- Filtering large datasets with string matching
- Custom `useDebounce` hook for performance optimization
- Case-insensitive search logic with clean UX
- Responsive grid and card layout using Tailwind CSS

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered:
- Debounce pattern using useEffect and setTimeout
- Conditional rendering for no-match fallback
- Modular architecture separating SearchBar, ResultList, and Dataset
- Optional feature extensions like keyword highlighting and item count

## 🛠 Features:
- Product list filtered in real-time as user types
- 300ms debounce delay to reduce re-renders
- Case-insensitive matching
- Tailwind-powered grid layout
- Handles large arrays of mock data

## ⚙️ Tech Stack:
- React.js (Functional Components)
- Custom Hooks (`useDebounce`)
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript string and array filtering methods

## 🔥 Why This Matters:
Search is a core feature in nearly every frontend app — from dashboards and ecommerce to admin panels. Today’s project balances performance and user experience, a concept often tested in top product interviews and real-world UI audits.

> Day 7 complete. Building search logic that feels intuitive and scales with your users.
